#### How to create a project when you are a confused ~~technobimbo~~ newbie. 

So how in the world do you come up with the idea of a name that reminds you of *__both__ the devil :smiling_imp: and [J.R.R.Tolkien](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orc "Orcs")*?
The answer is quite simple:

1. In the heat of recent discoveries, remember the famous **hello world** phrase. 
2. Don't forget the Russian description of your Master's group **РКИ**, which stands for ~~[РАКЕТНО-КОСМИЧЕСКИЕ ИНЖЕНЕРЫ](https://www.hse.ru/ma/foreign "РУССКИЙ КАК ИНОСТРАННЫЙ")~~
3. Combine until the result sounds strange enough
⋅⋅* Keep thinking that there might have been a better idea
4. ?????
5. Profit!
